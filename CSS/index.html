			Use the Source Monitor to preview clips before inserting them in a sequence. To play and pause playback use the playback controls, or press the Spacebar. You can also quickly drag (scrub) the blue playhead (current time indicator) at the bottom of the monitor to the section of the clip you want to play. Click the Mark In and Mark Out buttons to select a specific part of the source clip you want to add to the sequence.

			Use the Program Monitor to play your sequence. The Program Monitor playhead is synchronized with the playhead in the Timeline panel.
