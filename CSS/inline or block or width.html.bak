	The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadly stabbing spree at a festival in Germany on Friday that left three people dead and eight others injured.

	The group said the attacker targeted Christians and was a "soldier of the Islamic State" who carried out the attack "to avenge Muslims in Palestine and everywhere." 

	German police previously said that there was no other obvious motive other than terror and that the attacker appeared to be unknown to the victims.

	Late Saturday, authorities said that they had arrested a second person, along with a 15-year-old boy, in connection to the attack.
